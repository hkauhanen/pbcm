# pbcm

pbcm is an R package that implements both data-informed and data-uninformed versions of the Parametric Bootstrap Cross-fitting Method (PBCM; Wagenmakers et al. 2004), a general-purpose technique for binary model selection. Some auxiliary routines, such as decision through *k* nearest neighbours classification (Schultheis & Singhaniya 2015), are also implemented.

## Installation

You can install the released version of pbcm from [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org) with:

``` r
install.packages("pbcm")
```

## Basic usage

Suppose we have the following data:

``` r
x <- seq(from=0, to=1, length.out=100)
mockdata <- data.frame(x=x, y=x + rnorm(100, 0, 0.5))
```

and we wish to find out which of the following two models best explains these data:

* Model 1: $y = ax + \epsilon$
* Model 2: $y = ax^2 + \epsilon$

where $\epsilon$ is some Gaussian noise.



This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r example}
## basic example code
```

What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`? You can include R chunks like so:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

You'll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md` up-to-date.

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo = FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

In that case, don't forget to commit and push the resulting figure files, so they display on GitHub!
