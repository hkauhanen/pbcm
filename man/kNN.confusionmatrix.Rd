\title{Confusion Matrices through k Nearest Neighbours Classification}
\usage{
kNN.confusionmatrix(df, df.holdout, k, ties = "model2", verbose = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{df}{Data frame output by \code{\link{pbcm.di}} of \code{\link{pbcm.du}}}

\item{df.holdout}{Data frame output by \code{\link{pbcm.di}} of \code{\link{pbcm.du}}}

\item{k}{Number of neighbours to consider in k-NN classification; may be a vector of integers}

\item{ties}{Which way to break ties in k-NN classification (see \code{\link{kNN.classification}})}

\item{verbose}{If \code{TRUE}, prints a progress bar and issues warnings}
}
\value{
A data frame with the following columns:
\describe{
\item{\code{k}}{Number of nearest neighbours}
\item{\code{P}}{Number of positives}
\item{\code{N}}{Number of negatives}
\item{\code{TP}}{Number of true positives}
\item{\code{FP}}{Number of false positives}
\item{\code{TN}}{Number of true negatives}
\item{\code{FN}}{Number of false negatives}
\item{\code{alpha}}{Type I error (false positive) rate; equal to \code{FP} divided by \code{N}}
\item{\code{beta}}{Type II error (false negative) rate; equal to \code{FN}Â divided by \code{P}}
}
In addition to these columns, each argument that was passed via \code{genargs1} and \code{genargs2} to \code{\link{pbcm.di}} or \code{\link{pbcm.du}} to generate \code{df.holdout} is included as a column of its own.
}
\description{
Computes confusion matrices (one for each value of k) using k-NN classification from the results of two parametric bootstraps, one of these being labelled a holdout set and tested against the other one.
}
\details{
The function takes each DeltaGoF value from \code{df.holdout}, compares it against the DeltaGoF distributions in \code{df}, and decides based on k-NN classification. By convention, we take model 2 as the null hypothesis and model 1 as the alternative. Hence a false positive, for instance, means the situation where model 2 generated the data but the decision was in favour of model 1.
