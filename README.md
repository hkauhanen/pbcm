# pbcm

pbcm is an R package that implements both data-informed and data-uninformed versions of the Parametric Bootstrap Cross-fitting Method (PBCM; Wagenmakers et al. 2004), a general-purpose technique for binary model selection. Some auxiliary routines, such as decision through *k* nearest neighbours classification (Schultheis & Singhaniya 2015), are also implemented.

## Installation

You can install the released version of pbcm from [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org) with:

``` r
install.packages("pbcm")
```

## Basic usage

Suppose we have the following data:


```r
x <- seq(from=0, to=1, length.out=100)
mockdata <- data.frame(x=x, y=x^2 + rnorm(100, 0, 0.5))
library(ggplot2)
g <- ggplot(mockdata, aes(x=x, y=y)) + geom_point()
print(g)
```

Suppose we wish to find out which of the following two models best explains these data:

* Model 1: `y = a*x + E`
* Model 2: `y = a*x^2 + E`

where `E` is some Gaussian noise.

The first thing to do is to define our own routine for fitting these models. We could use a dedicated routine for each model, but because of the simplicity of the example and the obvious parallels between the two models, we're in fact going to parameterize a single function. We're going to use R's implementation of nonlinear least squares, `nls`, here:


```r
myfitfun <- function(data, p) {
  res <- nls(y~a*x^p, data, start=list(a=1.1))
  list(a=coef(res), GoF=deviance(res))
}
```

Note that `myfitfun` takes a (mandatory) `data` argument which is used to pass the data the models are fit to, and that it returns a list, one of whose elements holds the goodness of fit (`GoF`).

To generate the parametric bootstrap, we need another function that generates synthetic data based on a model parameterization:


```r
mygenfun <- function(model, p) {
  x <- seq(from=0, to=1, length.out=100)
  y <- model$a*x^p + rnorm(100, 0, 0.5)
  data.frame(x=x, y=y)
}
```

This function takes a mandatory `model` argument, which is used to pass around model realizations (the output of the `myfitfun` function).

Now we're set to actually run the bootstrap:


```r
myboot <- pbcm::pbcm.di(data=mockdata, fun1=myfitfun, fun2=myfitfun, genfun1=mygenfun, genfun2=mygenfun, reps=100, args1=list(p=1), args2=list(p=2), genargs1=list(p=1), genargs2=list(p=2))
```

Here, `args1` and `args2` hold arguments passed to `myfitfun`, while `genargs1` and `genargs2` hold arguments passed to `mygenfun`. Let's take a glimpse at the result:


```r
head(myboot)
#>   model1_p model2_p rep generator     GoF1     GoF2    DeltaGoF
#> 1        1       NA   1    model1 27.47036 27.49972 -0.02935368
#> 2        1       NA   2    model1 24.95514 25.91136 -0.95621473
#> 3        1       NA   3    model1 22.30481 23.29102 -0.98620087
#> 4        1       NA   4    model1 21.28250 21.94944 -0.66693605
#> 5        1       NA   5    model1 35.34166 36.39139 -1.04972890
#> 6        1       NA   6    model1 22.33365 22.92333 -0.58968065
```

We can easily produce a nice plot of the `DeltaGoF` distributions:


```r
g <- ggplot(myboot, aes(x=DeltaGoF, fill=generator)) + geom_density(alpha=0.5)
print(g)
```

![plot of chunk mybootplot](man/figures/README-mybootplot-1.png)

Since the definition of `DeltaGoF` is `GoF1 - GoF2`, and since we have defined `GoF` as the residual sum of squares of the regression (see our definition of `myfitfun` above), so that smaller is better, we find that model 1 tends to fit data generated by itself better than model 2, and vice versa (as expected). Now, which model is the better explanation of the original `mockdata`? To answer this, we first need the value of `DeltaGoF` for the original data:


```r
emp <- pbcm::empirical.GoF(mockdata, fun1=myfitfun, fun2=myfitfun, args1=list(p=1), args2=list(p=2))
print(emp)
#>       GoF1     GoF2 DeltaGoF
#> 1 28.39399 27.34459 1.049397
```

This suggests that model 1 is the true generator, since the empirical value of `DeltaGoF` would appear to be closer to that distribution. To get a more quantitative angle on this, we can use e.g. *k* nearest neighbours (*k*-NN) classification to decide the issue:


```r
pbcm::kNN.classification(df=myboot, DeltaGoF.emp=emp$DeltaGoF, k=10)
#>    k dist_model1 dist_model2 decision
#> 1 10    1.760608  0.05267519   model2
```

Comparing the empirical value of `DeltaGoF` to its 10 nearest neighbours in both bootstrap distributions, the distance to the model 1 distribution is smaller, hence model 1 is selected.

We can even try different values of *k* to see if that has any effect on the decision:


```r
pbcm::kNN.classification(df=myboot, DeltaGoF.emp=emp$DeltaGoF, k=c(1, 10, 50, 100))
#>     k  dist_model1  dist_model2 decision
#> 1   1 1.098331e-03 8.611434e-05   model2
#> 2  10 1.760608e+00 5.267519e-02   model2
#> 3  50 6.727387e+01 5.122212e+00   model2
#> 4 100 5.113761e+02 9.477548e+01   model2
```
