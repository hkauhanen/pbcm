# pbcm

pbcm is an R package that implements both data-informed and data-uninformed versions of the Parametric Bootstrap Cross-fitting Method (PBCM; Wagenmakers et al. 2004), a general-purpose technique for binary model selection. Some auxiliary routines, such as decision through *k* nearest neighbours classification (Schultheis & Singhaniya 2015), are also implemented.

For installation and usage instructions, please consult the [package website](http://henr.in/pbcm).
